Poorest of the poor often left out of health insurance since they cannot pay for the health insurance. This paper analyzes National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) data to study health insurance enrollments in India from an affordability point of view. We employ multivariate logistic regression to determine the effect of wealth and its interaction with religion, caste, and place of residence. Further, we use multivariate multinomial logistic (MNL) regression to estimate relative risk ratios (RRR) for the households enrolled under three insurance categories, namely employer-based health insurance, publicly funded health insurance, and private health insurance against the non-insured households. We observe an incremental effect of wealth on the enrollments across all caste groups and insurance types. Among the lower wealth quintiles, Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), and Other Backward Communities (OBC) have gained access to insurance largely due to publicly funded health insurance programs. In general, the odds of having health insurance are significantly lower for the Muslim households. The urban poor households also do not have adequate health insurance coverage. The newly launched Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PM-JAY) and other health insurance programs needs to specifically focus on reaching out to these unattended population groups.
