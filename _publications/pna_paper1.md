This paper argues that health policies should transcend national boundaries yet should not reach the supranational
level. Along with multinational global health efforts, such cross-national health policies are essential to leverage joint efforts by countries learning from their peers that experience similar health system challenges. In our analysis, we usedWorld Bank Health, Nutrition, and Population (HNP) data from 1995 to 2014 for East Asia Pacific (EAP) countries to explore health system comparability across member nations.We applied a hierarchical cluster analysis usingWardâ€™s method and a squared Euclidean
distance approach to classify 24 EAP countries into four relatively stable clusters based on their (dis)similarities over nine
selected health expenditure and health system performance related indicators. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to assess the discreteness of the formed clusters. Each cluster had unique characteristics based on the included indicators
and health system performance of the member countries. We present transnational health policy recommendations for the
EAP region based on both our use of robust methodology and the resulting comparative clusters.
