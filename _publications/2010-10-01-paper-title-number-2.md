Following the global mandate under Millennium Development Goals, and Sustainable Development Goals, India has introduced several healthcare programs in the recent decades. In this paper, we study the relative health performances of the poor vis-Ã -vis non-poor in India in the era of one such health program introduced in 2008, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). Using three waves of representative household data from the National Family Health Survey (1998-99, 2005-06, and 2015-16), we employ a difference-in-differences approach to examine the relative health performances of the poor (i.e., maternal and child health service utilization and child mortality). We also examine whether the relative improvement in the health outcomes of the poor varies by caste, religion, and place of residence. Among the main results, we find that in the RSBY environment, institutional and public hospital deliveries among the poor households are higher by 7 (p-value<0.01) and 8.5 (p-value<0.0.01) percentage points respectively, compared to the non-poor. The cesarean section deliveries are lower by nearly 4 percentage points (p-value<0.01). Also, we find that the poor from lower caste, tribal, Muslim community, and from rural areas have worse birth outcomes as compared to their non-poor counterparts. Thus, our results show that the relative health outcomes of the poor have improved in the era of RSBY and highlights the importance of social and geographical barriers to the health outcomes of the poor.
